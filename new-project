MadeEasy Marketing

Full Product & Build Brief for Developer Quote

This document is for development partners. It explains what MadeEasy must do, how it should behave, and how we want you to structure your quote and phases.

The goal is a clean, simple SaaS that a busy local business owner can actually use without getting lost.

â¸»

1. Overview

Product name: MadeEasy Marketing
Type: B2B SaaS web app for local service businesses

Who it is for
	â€¢	Trades: plumbers, electricians, joiners, roofers, heating engineers
	â€¢	Personal services: hair, beauty, barbers, gyms, PTs
	â€¢	Hospitality: cafÃ©s, coffee shops, small restaurants
	â€¢	Local clinics: physio, opticians, dentists, chiropractors

Primary geography to start: Leeds / West Yorkshire, then UK wide.

Core value

MadeEasy turns 10â€“15 minutes of the ownerâ€™s raw photos and clips into a month of posts on:
	â€¢	Google Business Profile
	â€¢	Facebook
	â€¢	Instagram

We use:
	â€¢	Human marketers to set tone, rules, and clean things up
	â€¢	AI to draft captions and ideas
	â€¢	A simple Visual Calendar for approvals
	â€¢	A Social Inbox to reply to comments and reviews
	â€¢	An Outcomes tab to show calls, directions and taps
	â€¢	A Smart Link page for simple attribution
	â€¢	Later: Local Boost â€œReach Packsâ€ to run one tap local ads from approved posts

Users always approve content before anything is published.

2. Tech stack and general requirements

2.1 Suggested stack

We expect something close to:
	â€¢	Backend: Laravel (PHP)
	â€¢	Frontend: React or Vue SPA
	â€¢	Database: MySQL or Postgres
	â€¢	Hosting: AWS (EC2/Fargate, RDS, S3, SQS or equivalent queue, CloudFront if needed)

If you propose something else, explain the stack and why. The stack must support:
	â€¢	Third party integrations (Meta, Google, Stripe)
	â€¢	Background jobs and queues
	â€¢	A separate admin panel
	â€¢	Future mobile apps talking to the same API

2.2 Non functional requirements
	â€¢	Mobile first, responsive web app
	â€¢	Fast page load and simple UI
	â€¢	Clean separation between:
	â€¢	User facing app
	â€¢	Internal admin / ops console
	â€¢	Structured logging and monitoring for:
	â€¢	API failures (Meta, Google, Stripe)
	â€¢	Post failures
	â€¢	Ad failures (later)
	â€¢	Environment based config:
	â€¢	Sandbox vs production keys
	â€¢	Feature flags for Local Boost and new features

Security basics:
	â€¢	Encrypted transport (HTTPS only)
	â€¢	Proper access control per role
	â€¢	No secrets in client code
	â€¢	GDPR aware (UK user base)

â¸»

3. Phasing and quote structure

You must provide:
	1.	Total estimate for full scope
	2.	Phase by phase breakdown with:
	â€¢	Features included per phase
	â€¢	Estimated hours or fixed fee per phase
	â€¢	Key dependencies or assumptions

We want three phases:
	â€¢	Phase 1 â€“ Core Product Launch
Usable app with trials, content, calendar, inbox, outcomes, smart link.
	â€¢	Phase 2 â€“ Quality and Depth
UX polish, Smart Link and Outcomes improvements, internal ops tools, basic roles.
	â€¢	Phase 3 â€“ Local Boost Ads Layer
Reach Packs, Meta and Google ads integration, Boost UI and reporting, fraud and safety logic.

You can suggest tweaks to the phase split, but each phase must be shippable and stable.

Implement role based access control across all routes and components.

â¸»

Phase 3 â€“ Local Boost Ads Layer (Reach Packs)

This is the ad system built on top of existing posts.

â¸»

7.1 Concept
Local Boost lets owners:
	â€¢	Tap a rocket icon on any approved or published post in the Calendar
	â€¢	Choose a fixed price Reach Pack (Weekend, Weekly, Monthly)
	â€¢	Confirm a simple radius (5 km or 10 km)
	â€¢	Charge their card on file
	â€¢	Have MadeEasy run a local ad on Meta (and later Google) using that post

We use our managed ad accounts. User sees results in the Outcomes tab as â€œBoost Impactâ€.

â¸»

7.2 UI details
In the Calendar:
	â€¢	Each eligible post shows a small rocket icon:
	â€¢	Grey: Boost available
	â€¢	Green: Boost running
	â€¢	Yellow: Boost completed

When user clicks the rocket:
	1.	Show a modal with:
	â€¢	Post preview
	â€¢	Short explanatory text:
	â€¢	â€œTurn this post into a local adâ€
	â€¢	Three pack options (copy can be configurable), for example:
	â€¢	Weekend Boost â€“ Â£15 â€“ 3 days â€“ Estimated reach range
	â€¢	Weekly Spotlight â€“ Â£35 â€“ 7 days â€“ Estimated reach range
	â€¢	Monthly Presence â€“ Â£100 â€“ 30 days â€“ Estimated reach range
	â€¢	Default pack selected (Weekly Spotlight)
	2.	Second step in same modal:
	â€¢	Simple map image centred on their address with radius overlay
	â€¢	Toggle inputs:
	â€¢	Standard radius (for example 5 km)
	â€¢	Extended radius (for example 10 km)
	3.	Confirmation:
	â€¢	Text: â€œCharge card ending in 8842â€
	â€¢	Single large button: â€œLaunch Boostâ€

After confirm:
	â€¢	Disable further edits on that Boost
	â€¢	Show status in Calendar and Outcomes

We do not want any daily budget sliders, advanced options or complicated controls.

â¸»

7.3 Backend and Meta integration
You should:
	â€¢	Integrate with Meta Marketing API
	â€¢	Use an opinionated structure:
	â€¢	One or two container campaigns per account:
	â€¢	Traffic and/or Reach
	â€¢	Each Boost becomes an ad set with:
	â€¢	Lifetime budget set to pack budget (net of fees and platform margin)
	â€¢	Geo radius targeting around business location
	â€¢	Auto placements (Advantage+)
	â€¢	Create an ad from the existing post:
	â€¢	Use the creative from the original post where possible
	â€¢	Or replicate it as a dark post if required by Meta

Caption logic:
	â€¢	Strip hashtags for the ad version
	â€¢	Use the same main text otherwise

Destination:
	â€¢	All Traffic Boosts should go to the business Smart Link URL

Budget handling:
	â€¢	Store pack price, VAT portion, estimated net media spend and platform margin for each Boost
	â€¢	Use lifetime budgets so no Boost can overspend due to bugs
	â€¢	Enforce per account weekly and monthly caps (for example Â£100 per week for new accounts in first 90 days, configurable in admin)

â¸»

7.4 Google local ads integration (later in Phase 3)
Once Meta is stable, add a simple Google option:
	â€¢	Use Google Local Services Ads or Smart Campaigns endpoints where possible
	â€¢	Derive all targeting from:
	â€¢	GBP category
	â€¢	Business address

No keyword input from the user.

Same principle:
	â€¢	Use highest quality weekly image as ad creative
	â€¢	Set budget to match Reach Pack
	â€¢	Maximize clicks or local actions strategies
	â€¢	Feed performance back into Outcomes tab

This can be a second sub phase inside Phase 3 if needed.

â¸»

7.5 Boost Impact reporting
Outcomes tab should get a new â€œBoost Impactâ€ card:
	â€¢	Visual:
	â€¢	Simple stacked bar or side by side bars:
	â€¢	Organic reach
	â€¢	Paid reach
	â€¢	Metrics per Boost:
	â€¢	Extra views / impressions
	â€¢	Visits to Smart Link that were paid
	â€¢	Paid button taps (call, directions, website)

Include a short text summary per Boost:

â€œYour Â£35 Boost added 3,420 views to this post and sent 42 extra visitors to your Smart Link. 8 of them tapped Call.â€

Data needed:
	â€¢	From Meta / Google:
	â€¢	Impressions, clicks
	â€¢	From Smart Link:
	â€¢	Visits tagged as paid from that campaign
	â€¢	Button taps

â¸»

7.6 Fraud and safety
We need basic protection:
	â€¢	Only accounts that:
	â€¢	Completed onboarding
	â€¢	Have a valid card
	â€¢	Are not flagged for risk

can use Boost.

Controls:
	â€¢	Per account spend caps:
	â€¢	Configurable in admin (for example Â£100 per week in first 90 days)
	â€¢	Use lifetime budgets on all ad sets
	â€¢	Summaries in admin panel showing:
	â€¢	Packs bought
	â€¢	Media spend owed to Meta/Google
	â€¢	Exceptions and ad rejections

If ad is rejected:
	â€¢	Stop further spend
	â€¢	Mark Boost as rejected
	â€¢	Credit unused portion of pack back as internal Boost credit (not cash)
	â€¢	Flag reason in internal log and show simple message to user

â¸»

8. Admin, security and logging

Admin panel should include:
	â€¢	User and account management (plans, status, last login, last posting date)
	â€¢	Billing overview and link to Stripe dashboard
	â€¢	Flags:
	â€¢	Ad risk level per account (low / high)
	â€¢	Boost history and spend
	â€¢	API error counts per integration

Logging:
	â€¢	Centralised error logging (for example Sentry)
	â€¢	API call logs for:
	â€¢	Meta marketing endpoints
	â€¢	Google APIs
	â€¢	Stripe events

Basic audit trails:
	â€¢	Who changed what in:
	â€¢	Plans and discounts
	â€¢	Boost caps
	â€¢	Role assignments
